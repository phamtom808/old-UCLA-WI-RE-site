		<h3>Skimming for What You Need</h3>
		<ul class="browser-default activator">
			<li><b>Look for landmarks.</b> Journal articles generally follow a set structure with titled subsections like <i>Problem Statement</i> or <i>Research Methods &amp; Design</i> that allow you to skip to the content you need.</li>
			<li><b>Take notes as you go.</b> While you may remember the central argument or findings of a resource now, after you look through a whole body of research you may lose the nuances of individual pieces. Important things to keep track of may include central ideas, research methods, referenced works, and refuted or counter-argued ideas. </li>
